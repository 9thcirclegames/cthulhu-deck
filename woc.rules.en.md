## Game Components

* 4 __Seeker Markers__ in different colors, 1 per player;
* 4 __Search Order Counters__, with a number ranging from 1 to 4;
* 4 __Elder Sign Markers__, in different colors, 1 per player;
* 4 __Ritual Tokens__ in different colors, 1 per player;
* 24 __Research Cards__, 6 per player with a color border matching her Seeker marker;
* 72 __Knowledge Cards__ so divided: 36 _Forbidden Wisdom_, 24 _Alien Science_, 12 _Dark Master_;
* 24 __Entity__ cards;
* 12 __Arcane Place__ tiles: 4 _Cities_, 4 _Ruins_, 4 _Elsewhere_;
* 4 __Great Old One__ cards;
* 1 __Ritual Dashboard__;
* __XXX Knowledge Points__ counters of various values.

## Game Setup
Players take a _Seeker_ marker, a set of 6 _Research_ cards, a _Great Old One_ marker, and a _Ritual_ token, all of the same color. These elements are placed in front of the player clearly visible to the opponents. This is the personal area, where the purchased cards will be located and the KPs collected. It is also called __Learning Area__.

Separate the Knowledge Cards by colors and shuffle them to form three drawing decks. Do the same with the _Entity_ cards and form a separate deck.

Designate an area where all the players can easily access for the Great Old Ones and the Entities.

The number of Great Old One cards and Entity cards in play at the beginning of the game depends on to the number of players:

* __2 Players__: 2 _Great Old One_ cards and 2 _Entity_ cards.
* __3 Players__: 3 _Great Old One_ cards and 3 _Entity_ cards.
* __4 Players__: 4 _Great Old One_ cards and 4 _Entity_ cards.

The Great Old Ones can be chosen at random by players or according to the type of game they want to play. They are placed on the top of the Evocation Area, accessible to all players. They won't be moved from that position during the game.

Entities are drawn from their deck and positioned to form a row immediately below the Great Old Ones. Each time one of these cards is put into play or discarded, at the end of the round, it is replaced by drawing a new Entity from the top of the deck.

The area so delimited is the  __Evocation Area__ and is where the Entity cards come into play.

Immediately below the Entity cards is placed the _Ritual Dashboard_. At the first position of the dashboard, the _Ritual Counters_ of each player are finally placed.

Place the _Arcane Places_ to form a perimeter at the center of the table. This perimeter delimits the placement and purchase area of Knowledge Cards and thus it is called __Research Area__. The number of Arcane Places to place depends on the number of players:

* __2 players__: 6 Arcane Places.
* __3 players__: 9 Arcane Places.
* __4 players__: 12 Arcane Places.

In 2 players games, use the Arcane Places with the _2+_ on the back. In 3 players games, you must add the ones with the _3+_ on the back (for a total of 9). In 4 players you must add the remaining tiles, which have the number _4+_ on the back (for a total of 12 Arcane Places).

Place the initial set of _Knowledge Cards_ in the Research Area, drawing drawn from their decks accordingly to the number of players:

* __2 players__: 3 ![FW](icon.forbidden-wisdom.png){height="16" width="16"}, 2 ![AS](icon.alien-science.png){height="16" width="16"}, 1 ![DM](icon.dark-master.png){height="16" width="16"};
* __3 players__: 5 ![FW](icon.forbidden-wisdom.png){height="16" width="16"}, 2 ![AS](icon.alien-science.png){height="16" width="16"}, 1 ![DM](icon.dark-master.png){height="16" width="16"};.
* __4 players__: 6 ![FW](icon.forbidden-wisdom.png){height="16" width="16"}, 4 ![AS](icon.alien-science.png){height="16" width="16"}, 2 ![DM](icon.dark-master.png){height="16" width="16"};

At the end of each turn, the Research Area is cleaned: the Knowledge Cards left on the table are discarded and the whole area is cleansed. At the start of each turn, new Knowledge Cards are drawn and placed in the quantities indicated shortly before.

Place the _Search Order_ counters by selecting the number of them according to the number of players:

* __2 players__: 1, 2;
* __3 players__: 1, 2, 3;
* __4 players__: 1, 2, 3, 4.

## Cards
### ![Res](icon.research.png){height="32" width="32"} ![Obs](icon.obsession.png){height="32" width="32"} Research Cards
Double-faced cards, six for each player. The front is a _Research_ (![Res](icon.research.png){height="16" width="16"}), while the back is an _Obsession_ (![Res](icon.obsession.png){height="16" width="16"}).

On the ![Res](icon.research.png){height="16" width="16"} side, there is a combination of two seeds, with symbols pairing to Knowledge Cards and with these couples:

* ![FW](icon.forbidden-wisdom.png){height="16" width="16"}/![FW](icon.forbidden-wisdom.png){height="16" width="16"}, ![FW](icon.forbidden-wisdom.png){height="16" width="16"}/![AS](icon.alien-science.png){height="16" width="16"}, ![FW](icon.forbidden-wisdom.png){height="16" width="16"}/![DM](icon.dark-master.png){height="16" width="16"}
* ![AS](icon.alien-science.png){height="16" width="16"}/![AS](icon.alien-science.png){height="16" width="16"}, ![AS](icon.alien-science.png){height="16" width="16"}/![DM](icon.dark-master.png){height="16" width="16"}
* ![DM](icon.dark-master.png){height="16" width="16"}/![DM](icon.dark-master.png){height="16" width="16"}

By spending a _Research_ card, you can buy one, and only one, Knowledge Card of the same seed of one of those printed on the card being spent. For "buying" the Knowledge card this way,  the Seeker marker must be on an Arcane Place that has the same seed of the Knowledge Card you intend to buy.

Once spent, the _Research_ is discarded in a discard pile which is located outside the Player's Research Area. Be careful to not confuse those cards with the _Obsessions_ already in plat game (see below). Note that only one Knowledge card can be purchased with a Research, even if the latter has two seeds printed on it.

During the _Search Order Phase_ (see below), each player chooses a number of Researches  to place in his Research Area flipped on the Obsession side. The player chooses how many cards he wants to turn, even none. These cards are _Temporary Obsessions_ and are placed to the right of the player in his Research Area. Each time a player performs a __Research__ action, if required, discard a Obsession Card. Each Obsession card give the possibility to the owner to perform one, and only one, _Research_ action.

During the _Obsession Phase_ of each turn (see), players will take over all the _Researches_ and _Temporary Obsessions_ that are eventually available. Among these cards, one is selected to be placed on the Obsession side for the rest of the game, thus becoming a __Permanent Obsession__. This card can be used as a normal Obsession Card, but will no longer be withdraw in the hands of the player for the rest of the game, thus cannot be flipped back on the _Research_ side anymore. Therefore, the Permanent Obsessions are placed to the left of the player in his Research Area to avoid being mixed with Temporary Obsessions.

This way, during the game, the player will have less Study Cards for purchasing Knowledge Cards, but they will have more Obsessions Cards to be used for Research Actions, simulating the slowing descent to the insanity of this unholy wisdom.

### Knowledge Cards
In general, these cards include a seed and the number of Knowledge Points they give to their owner. Knowledge Cards are subdivided into __Forbidden Wisdom__ (![FW](icon.forbidden-wisdom.png){height="16" width="16"}), __Alien Science__ (![AS](icon.alien-science.png){height="16" width="16"}) and __Dark Master__ (![DM](icon.dark-master.png){height="16" width="16"}), They are characterized by one or more of the following __Powers__:

* __Continuous__ (Cont): the card is placed in the Player's Research Area and it always has effect. Each time the Power of the card has effect, the owner gains a given number of Knowledge Points, as stated on the card itself.
* __Activation__ (Act): the card is placed in the Player's Learning Area. When activated, at the expense of one Obsession, the Power has effect and the card is turned face down: it is no longer available for the rest of the turn. Each activation gives to the owner the given number of Knowledge Points stated on the card itself.
* __Immediate__ (Imm): at the time of purchase, the effect of the Power is immediately applied and the card is discarded. As soon as the owner applies the effects of the Power and discards the card, he gains the number of Knowledge Points printed on the card.
* __Combination__ (Comb): these cards are placed in the Player's Research Area. They describe a list of other cards to be purchased in order to gain the Knowledge Points associated with it and make other cumulative Powers available. The cards purchased to complete the combination, called __Components__, are placed face-up below the main _Combination_ card and are not considered in play. When the combination is complete, the Power printed on the Combination is activated and follows the rules described. If it is Immediate, the Combination card will be discarded with all the associated Components. If it is an Activation card, it can be normally turned on activating its Power. If it is a Continuous card, the Power always has effect after all the Components were gathered. In the last two cases, the Component cards continue to be unusable.
* __Dark Bond__: some cards have this caption and the seed of a Great Old One to whom they are associated. These symbols are in turn displayed on various game elements (Arcane Place tiles, Great Old Ones cards, Ritual Object cards, Entity cards). Each time the Power of one of these elements is used by the player, the cards in his possession and the Dark Bond carrying the same seed will make the owner get the number of Knowledge Points indicated by the cards themselves. Cards with the Dark Bond can also bring a Power according to the aforementioned types already described.
* __Ritual Object__: some Knowledge Cards can act as _Ritual Object_ cards. These cards are fundamental for using the powers of Invocation of the Great Old Ones and for evoking them (see below). Ritual Objects are normal Knowledge Cards with one or more of the powers already described. The only difference that, when they are purchased, they are always placed in the Player's Learning Area. If it is a Continuous Card, Power always has effect and at the same time it counts as a Ritual Object. If it is an Immediate card, when you decide to use its Power, it should be discarded as usual and so it cannot be used as a Ritual Object anymore. If it is an Activation card and its power is activated, it is no longer considered a Ritual Object for the remainder of the turn. If it is a Combination card, after completing the combination, it should normally be treated as described. Each Ritual Object has a Dark Bond link associated to the Great Old One which the card is able to evoke. To advance the Ritual token on the Ritual Dashboard, the requirements printed on the card itself must be fulfilled (see below).

As said before, Knowledge cards can be of one of these three seeds:

* __Forbidden Wisdom__ (FW): these are the most common cards in the Learning Area and represent tomes, artifacts, and spells. Each card has its own seed for purchasing (spending a Research Card of the same seed), the number of Knowledge Points rewarded to its owner, one or more Powers and any requirements it may have for acting as Ritual Object.
* __Alien Science__ (AS): these cards represent nonhuman technologies and notions. Each card has its own seed for purchasing (spending a Research Card of the same seed), the combination to complete, the number of Knowledge Points it rewards its owner,  one or more Powers and any requirements it may have for acting as Ritual Object.
* __Dark Master__ (DM): these cards represent scholars, magicians and scientists having a respectable knowledge of Cthulhu's Mythos. Each card has its own seed for purchasing (spending a Research Card of the same seed), a Dark Bond, the number of Knowledge Points it rewards to its owner, one or more Powers and any requirements it may have for acting as Ritual Object. Remember that the Dark Masters follow the rules of the Dark Bond as stated above: whenever a Power of an Element with the same Dark Bond of a Dark Master is used, the owner gets the Knowledge Points for the Dark Master card itself.

For the Dark Masters, the following _Dark Bonds_ apply:

* Powers of Arcane Places, which can be activated using Obsession cards;
* Summoning Powers on Great Old Ones cards;
* Powers on Entity cards;
* Fulfilling the requirements on Ritual cards (see above) which are not Dark Masters themselves.


### ![En](icon.entity.png){height="32" width="32"} Entity Cards
Entities are not Knowledge Cards and therefore do not give Knowledge Points to their owners. These cards are purchased by spending Obsessions, rather than Paths, when your Seeker is on an Arcane Place of the same seed printed on the Entity you want to invoke. Entities have the same types of Powers described above. Each card has the seed for the purchase, a Dark Bond and one or more Powers.

### ![Obs](icon.arcane-place.png){height="32" width="32"} Arcane Places
Arcane Places are divided into three types:

* __City__
* __Ruins__
* __Elsewhere__

Each card contains the icon of the type it belongs to, the seeds of the Knowledge Cards and Entities that allows the player to get, one or more Powers as described above, and the Dark Bond with one of the Great Old Ones in game.

A _Research_ action allows you to explore an Arcane Place with different effects. In order to be able to explore a place, you have to move your Seeker marker onto the Place you want to explore.

Bringing the Seeker on a site is free and that marker stays on the card until the player decides to move it elsewhere, or he or she explore the site or an external factor (some Powers on Knowledge Cards) forces it to move away from the card. The marker is positioned during the Search phase and can be moved to place in place, compatible with the Research Actions available to the player. Once exploring the site, thus taking advantage of the benefits of the Place, the Seeker marker returns to its owner. An Arcane Place can be occupied by only one marker at a time so, until it is released, no other marker can be placed on the card. Instead, placing an Elder Sign (see) on an occupied Arcane Place will force the owner of the Seeker marker to withdraw it.

A player can always place his marker on a place where his Elder Sign is present (see below).

An Arcane Place must be considered as "explored" when one of the following applies:

* __Purchase of Knowledge cards.__ The seeds on the Place cards indicate which Knowledge Cards they allow the players to acquire at cost of their Path cards. Once you move the Seeker marker to a place with a Research action, you can immediately spend a Research Card of the same seed to acquire a Knowledge Card of that seed. This mechanism also applies to the Entity cards acquired with the Obsession cards. After purchase, the Seeker marker returns to its owner.
* __Use the Arcane Power of the Place__, by spending the required Obsession. As above, the Seeker token returns to its owner. In this case, also, remember to take the amount of Knowledge Points indicated by the Dark Master cards in your possession with the Dark Bond symbol equal to the one on the place itself.

During the game, for the Obsession Phase procedure, the Searchers will be able to spend less and less Search Cards to get Knowledge Cards. In this case, players can still take advantage of the places to acquire resources even if they do not have the related Search Card. In fact, once the Searcher Marker is brought to the desired card, players can acquire a resource indicated by the seed present at the site at the cost of an Obsession Card.
Until the end of the turn, however, they will not be able to acquire any other Knowledge Cards of any kind, and the Arcane Place cards may only be used to acquire Entity cards and to activate Powers of the places.
Buying free resources from places is possible if and only if players no longer have Search Cards to use. When at least one Search Card is available, buying Knowledge Cards is not possible as described above. With this action the site is considered explored, therefore the Finder marker returns to its owner.

## Elder Sign markers
The Great Old Ones marker is used to block and make a game element unusable. During the Search phase, spending an Obsession Card, you can place your Great Old Ones marker as a Search Action. The Great Old Ones marker can be placed on the following elements:
* A __Knowledge Card__ in the Search Area or the opponent’s Learning Area.
Blocked cards in the Search Area cannot be purchased, except from the owner of the marker. Blocked Cards in Learning Areas cannot be played. In addition, if the blocked card is a ritual object, it will not be possible to complete its ritual requirements.
* An __Entity Card__ in the Evocation Area or in the opponent’s Learning Area.
Blocked cards in the Evocation Area cannot be purchased, except from the owner of the marker. Blocked Cards in Learning Areas cannot be played.
* An __Arcane Place__ Card.
Blocked cards cannot be occupied by a Searcher Marker, except that of the owner of the Great Old Ones marker. It is possible to place a Great Old Ones marker on a card occupied by an opponent’s Searcher Marker, in this case the latter is discarded and returns to the owner's hand.
* One of the __Invocation Powers__ of any Great Old Ones Cards. Power is inaccessible for its use, except from the owner of the marker. The Great Old Ones marker can only be placed on a Invocation Power, never on a Power of Evocation. When a particular Great Old Ones comes into play with the Evocation (see), you will not be able to place a Great Old Ones marker on any Power of your card. The Great Old Ones marker remains in play until the end of the turn and then returns to its owner. It is possible, however, to remove an opponent’s Great Old Ones Marker with a Search Action by spending an Obsession Card. The Marker is discarded for the entire turn (without returning to its owner) and the released item cannot be used and / or purchased with the same action, it can with a subsequent action.

## Great Old Ones Cards and Ritual Dashboard
During the game, using the Ritual Object cards, there is a chance for players to advance on the Ritual Dashboard and evoke one of the Great Old Ones.
Each Great Old Ones Card has a Dark Bond symbol. These symbols are also shown on the Ritual Object cards indicating what Great Old One they can evoke completing their ritual requirements.

In the game the number of Great Old Ones Cards depends on the number of players, who will take advantage of their Invocation Powers. The first player who can complete the entire path on the Ritual Dashboard will be able to _evoke_ a specific Great Old One, discarding other Grat Old Ones cards in play.

The steps to follow for the Summoning and the Evocation of the Great Old Ones, using the Ritual Objects, are as follows:
* Ritual Object Cards are put into play in their Learning Area regardless of their type of Power, as described above (see);
* They may have any number at stake, with a Dark Bond of different Great Old Ones;
* Ritual requirements do not count as actions so, to satisfy them, you do not need to spend Research Cards or Obsession Cards. They are conditions to be checked during the turn. If a condition is met, the requirement is considered complete and you can check the next one. Ritual requirements are always in the number of three:

1.  __Study:__ Have something at the beginning of the turn;
2.  __Transmutation:__ Acquire something during the turn;
3. __Sacrifice:__ discard something at the end of next turn.

To indicate that a requirement has been met, the card has to be rotated 90° to the right each time (N.B.: when a card has been rotated three times, meeting all the requirements, player immediately acquires the Cards Knowledge Points with the same Dark Bond of the Ritual Object in question);

* Each completed requirement corresponds to an advance of their own Ritual Marker on the Ritual Dashboard;
* Powers completing free requirements, or making progress on the Ritual Dashboard directly, reduce requirements of a chosen card by one in effect: Ritual Object can be rotated 90°;
* If a Ritual Object Card is discarded, the advancements on the Ritual Dashboard are not lost;
* It is possible to advance on the Ritual Dashboard by considering the requirements of multiple Ritual Object Cards, with the restriction that the requirements themselves must be fully met in sequence (Study, Transmutation, Sacrifice). So, for example, for the advancement you can consider the Study requirement of a card, then the Transmutation requirement of another. If progress is obtained by considering Ritual Object cards from the same Dark Bond there is no penalty. On the other hand, if cards by the different Dark Bonds have been considered, advancement costs 5 Knowledge Points, instead.
* On Ritual Dashboard position of the Ritual Marker indicates which Powers of the Great Old Ones Cards the player has access to.
The first and second boxes are related to the first and second Invocation Power. Invocation Powers of any Great Old One card in play can be used, provided that you have the same Dark Bond of Ritual Objects rotated according to their advances. Invocation Powers work as described for the Powers of Arcane Place Cards (see): player must bring, with a Research action, his/her Seeker Marker on the card of the chosen Great Old to use its related power.

The third box is related to the _Evocation_ of a Great Old One. As soon as the Ritual Marker advances to this position, player chooses a Great Old Ones Card with the same Dark Bond of the Ritual Object that has allowed the advance on the Evocation box. Player also removes the remaining Great Old Ones from the game (discarding any Search Markers that return to respective owners). Player immediately uses the Evocation Power of the chosen Great Old One, which is now considered the only one in the game.
* From now on, players holding Ritual Object cards of the same Dark Bond of the Great Old One can use its Powers as described above. In addition to this, since the Great Old One has come into play, the __Great Old Ones Influence__ Power also becomes available.

## Game Turns
The Game Turn is divided into four phases that, once done in their entirety, determine its end and the transition to the next turn. During the Research Order Phase (see), when all players have completed a Research Action, a round is completed. It's good to point out the difference between turn and round as the game effects specifically refer to them.
During the course of the game, Powers of cards and any other element take precedence over general rules.
Knowledge Cards and Entity Cards, when discarded, are faced up in their discarded decks, so that the first card of the deck is visible to everyone. When a counter is discarded it returns to its owner, unless otherwise specified.

The Game Turn is divided as follows:
* Research Preparation;
* Research Order;
* Research;
* End of Search.

### Research Preparation
(this phase will not happen in the initial turn, jump to the next):
According to this sequence at the beginning of a new turn, the following steps will be taken:

1. According to the Search Order (see), any possible effects of cards with the words “start of the turn” apply
2. The Requirements of the Ritual Object Cards (with the consequent advance of the Ritual Marker on the Ritual Dashboard) are checked;
3. Knowledge Cards that remain in the Search Area from the previous turn are discarded.
New Knowledge Cards are drawn from their deck and placed in the Search Area, in number depending on the number of players (see);
4. Activation Knowledge Cards used in the previous turn are turned face-up, becoming available for the player;
5. Seeker markers and the Great Old Ones Markers in the play area return to their respective owners. This applies to any discarded markers during the turn and for those on the Arcane Place, Great Old Ones, and Knowledge Cards (both in the Research Area and in the opposing Learning Areas);

### Research Order
This phase is used to determine the turn order.
Players choose and declare, one at a time, how many of their own Search Cards will face on the Temporary Obsession Card side. In the first turn this choice will take place clockwise, randomly determining who is the first to start. At the end of the statement turn there will be a second, when players will be able to place other Obsession Cards. At the end of the second turn, who have the higher number of Obsession Cards will receive the Search Order counter marked with 1, becoming the first player. Other players will pick up the remaining tokens (from 2 onwards) in a decreasing order of Obsession Cards. In the case of parity, during the statement player who first has put into play that amount of Obsession Cards will get the marker. In following turns, Obsession Cards are declared using the order of the previous turn.

### Research
At this stage, purchases are made, the different elements of the game are activated and counters are used. Keep in mind that, at the beginning of the phase, players will have in hand a certain amount of Search Cards, needed to buy cards, and in front of them a certain amount of Obsession Cards for other actions. These quantities depend on the previous ‘Search Order’ phase.

According to the Research Order each player performs a Research action which allows him to do one and only one of the following:
* Players can buy cards from the Search Area.
In order to do so, Searcher marker has to be moved to an Arcane Place card that is not blocked by a Great Old Ones marker or occupied by another Searcher marker. Moving your Marker is not considered as an action and it does not cost Search cards or Obsession cards. At this point, you can purchase Knowledge Cards that have the same symbol as that from the Arcade Place card where your marker is located, discarding a Search Card with that symbol.

When Knowledge Card is an Immediate Card, it is played immediately without having to spend any other Search Cards or Obsession Cards. When it is a Continuous, Activation or Combination card, it can be placed in your Learning Area and played from the next round. When it acts as a Ritual Object card, it can be placed in Learning Area and meet its requirements from the current turn if possible. If the purchased card has to be used as a Component card, it will be placed under a suitable Combination Card without taking into account its powers or other effects.

Once you have purchased a Knowledge card from the Search Area, it will not be replaced by any new card until the beginning of the next turn (see).

*  They can purchase an Entity Card at the cost of an Obsession Card, and play it according to the type it belongs to (remember to take Dark Masters’ Knowledge Points from the same Dark Bond). Finder marker must be on a site that allows buying Entity cards, as for the Search Cards. The purchased card will be replaced at the end of the round so that there will always be the maximum number of Entity cards in the Evocation Area.
* They can use the power of an Activation card in their Learning Area by spending an Obsession Card. It has to be turned face down when its power is used.
* Players can set a Elder Sign marker by spending an Obsession Card. This marker can be placed on a card in the Research Area, on an Entity Card in the Evocation Area, on a Invocation Power of a Great Old Ones not yet evoked, on any card in the opposing Learning Area and on an Arcane Place card.
* They can discard, for the full turn, one opponent's Elder Sign spending an Obsession Card. The released object cannot be used and/or purchased with the same action.
* They can use the power of an Arcane Place on which their _Seeker_ marker is located, by spending an Obsession Card if required. With the same action the Seeker marker can be moved and the Power of the chosen place can be used immediately (remember to take Dark Masters’ Knowledge Points from the same Dark Bond, see).
* Player can use the Invocation Powers of a Great Old Ones Cards not yet evoked (see) and over which Seeker Marker is located. With the same action the Seeker marker can be moved and the power of the chosen Great Old Ones card can be used immediately, according to the requirements of the owned Ritual Object cards (remember to take Dark Masters’ Knowledge Points from the same Dark Bond).
* They can discard a Search Card to have 2 Knowledge Points or an Obsession Card to have 1 Knowledge Point.

The round ends when each of all players has done a Research action. The rounds will continue until each player has completed Search Cards and Obsession Cards to perform Search actions

Keep in mind, during the turn, to advance Ritual Marker on the Ritual Dashboard when the requirements of the owned Ritual Object cards are met. Its advancement is not considered as a Research action and therefore it is performed as soon as the requirement is met, regardless the Research Order.

During the Research phase players must perform one of the actions listed above, so they are not allowed to skip their own turn.
The Search phase ends when everyone has completed their usable Search and Obsession Cards.

## End of game
According to this sequence at the end of each turn, the following steps will be taken:

1. According to the Search Order (see), any card effects with the term "end of turn" apply.
2. Requirements of Ritual Object Cards are monitored (resulting in the advance of the Ritual Marker on the Ritual Dashboard). When a Ritual Object meets its last ritual requirement, remember to take Dark Masters’ Knowledge Points from the same Dark Bond. Then, proceed to the Summon of a Great Old Ones card (see) if conditions allow it.
3. Unused Temporary Obsession Cards and discarded Search Cards are taken in hand (remember not to resume Permanent Obsession Cards).
4. Obsession step begins: players must choose one of their own Search Cards in hand to place on the Obsession Card side for the rest of the game. It cannot be used in any other way in next turns, becoming a Permanent Obsession card.
5. Current Knowledge Points are counted.

The game lasts 6 rounds, when performing the Obsession step players will place their last Search Card on the Obsession Card side in their Learning Area. At this point, the acquired Knowledge Points are counted and win who has the higher number of points.
