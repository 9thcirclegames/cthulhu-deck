# Wisdom of Cthulhu Card Game
## Game Overview
Wisdom of Cthulhu is a card game in which players interpret searchers of forgotten and forbidden knowledge that will lead them slowly into a spiral of insane obsession. Scientists, magicians and scholars who will try to contend for alien objects, banned books, the help of obscure scholars, and the evocation of powerful creatures to get the ultimate end to the truth about Cthulhu's myths.

During the match, which is divided into six rounds, players, acquiring and discarding cards, get Knowledge Points (KPs).

At the end of the game, who has more Knowledge Points is the winner.

	* 24 __Alien Science cards__, green in back and front;
	* 12 __Dark Master cards__, blue in back and front;
	* 24 __Entity cards__, red in back and front;

## Game Setup
Players take a _Seeker_ marker, a set of 6 _Paths to Knowledge_, a _Great Old One_ marker, and a _Ritual_ marker, all of the same color. These elements are placed in front of the player clearly visible to the opponents. This is the personal area, where the purchased cards will be located and the KPs collected. It is also called is __Learning Area__ (LA).

Separate the Knowledge Cards by colors and shuffle them to form three drawing decks. Do the same with the Entity cards and form a separate deck.

Designate an area where all the players can easily access and put a _Great Old One_ and the _Ritual dashboard_. This area is called __Evocation Area__ and is where the Entity cards come into play.

The number of Great Old One cards and Entity cards in play at the beginning of the game is equal to the number of players:

* __2 Players__ -> 2 Great Old Ones and 2 Entities.
* __3 Players__ -> 3 Great Old Ones and 3 Entities.
* __4 Players__ -> 4 Great Old Ones and 4 Entities.


The Great Old Ones can be chosen at random by players or according to the type of game they want to play. The Great Old Ones are placed on the top of the Evocation Area, accessible to all players. They wonâ€™t be moved from that position during the game.

Entities are drawn from the deck and positioned to form a row immediately below the Great Old Ones tiles. Each time one of these cards is put into play or discarded, at the end of the round, it is replaced by drawing a new Entity from the top of the deck.

Immediately below the Entity cards is placed the _Ritual Dashboard_. At the first position of the dashboard, the _Ritual Counters_ of each player are finally placed.

Place the _Arcane Places_ to form a perimeter at the center of the table. This perimeter delimits the placement and purchase area of Knowledge Cards and thus it is called __Research Area__ (RA). The number of Arcane Places depends of the number of players:

* __2 players__ -> 6 Arcane Places.
* __3 players__ -> 9 Arcane Places.
* __4 players__ -> 12 Arcane Places.


In 2 players games, the tiles to be placed are the ones indicated with the _2_ on the back. In 3 players games, you must add the ones with the _3_ on the back (for a total of 9). In 4 players you must add the remaining tiles, which has the number _4_ on the back (for a total of 12).

Place the _Knowledge Cards_ in the Research Area, randomly drawn from the relative decks in a number according to the number of players:

* __2 players__ -> 6 Knowledge Cards: 3 Forbidden Wisdom, 2 Alien Science, 1 Dark Master.
* __3 players__ -> 9 Knowledge Cards: 5 Forbidden Wisdom, 3 Alien Science, 1 Dark Master.
* __4 players__ -> 12 Knowledge Cards: 6 Forbidden Wisdom, 4 Alien Science, 2 Dark Master.
* 
At the end of each turn, the Research Area is cleaned: the Knowledge Cards left on the table are discarded and the whiole area is cleansed. At the start of each turn, new Knowledge Cards are drawn and placed in the quantities indicated shortly before.

Place the _Search Order_ counters by selecting the number of them according to the number of players:

* __2 players__ -> 1, 2; 
* __3 players__ -> 1, 2, 3; 
* __4 players__ -> 1, 2, 3, 4.

## Cards
### Paths to Knowlege 
Double-faced cards. The front is a _Path to Knowledge_ (P2K); The back represents an _Obsession_ (OB). Six for each player. On the _Path_ side, there is a combination of two seeds, with symbols pairing to Knowledge Cards and according to this schema:

__Legenda:__ Forbidden Wisdom (FW); Alien Science (AS); Dark Master (DM)

* __FW/FW; FW/AL; FW/DM__
* __SL/DM; AS/AS__
* __DM/DM__

By spending a _Path_ card, you can buy one, and only one, Knowledge Card of the same seed of one of those printed on the card being spent. For "buying" the Knowledge card this way,  the Seeker marker must be on an Arcane Place that has the same seed of the Knowledge Card you intend to buy. 

Once spent, the _Path_ is discarded in a discard pile which is located outside the Player's Research Area. Be careful to not confuse those cards with the _Obsessios_ already in plat game (see below). Note that only one Knowledge card can be purchased with a Path, even if the latter has two seeds printed on it.

During the _Search Order Phase_ (see below), each player chooses a number of Paths  to place in his Research Area flipped on the Obsession side. The player chooses how many cards he wants to turn, even none. These cards are _Temporary Obsessions_ and are placed to the right of the player in his Research Area. Each time a player performs a __Research__ action, if required, discard a Obsession Card. Each Obession card give the possibility to the owner to perform one, and only one, _Research_ action.

During the _Obsession Phase_ of each turn (see), players will take over all the _Paths_ and _Temporary Obsessios_ that are eventually available. Among these cards, one d is selected to be placed on the Obsession side for the rest of the game, thus becoming a __Permanent Obsession__. This card can be used as a normal Obsession Card, but will no longer be withdraw in the hands of the player for the rest of the game, thus cannot be flipped back on the _Path_ side anymore. Therefore, the Permanent Obsessions are placed to the left of the player in his Research Area to avoid being mixed with Temporary Obsessions.

This way, during the game, the player will have less Study Cards for purchasing Knowledge Cards, but they will have more Obsessions Cards to be used for Research Actions, simulating the slowing descent to the insanity of this un holy wisdom.

### Knowledge Cards
In general, these cards include a seed and the number of Knowledge Points that give to their owner. Knowledge Cards are subdivided into __Forbidden Wisdom__ (FW), __Alien Science__ (AS) and __Dark Master__ (DM), They are characterized by one or more of the following __Powers__:

* __Continuous__ (Cont): the card is placed in the Player's Research Area and it always has effect. Each time the Power of the card has effect, the owner gains a given number of Knowledge Points, as stated on the card itself.
* __Activation__ (Act): the card is placed in the Player's Learning Area. When activated, at the expense of one Obsession, the Pwer has effect and the card is turned face down: it is no longer available for the rest of the turn. Each activation gives to the owner the given number of Knowledge Points stated on the card itself.
* __Immediate__ (Imm): at the time of purchase, the effect of the Power is immediately applied and the card discard. As soon as the owner applies the effects of the Power and discards the card, he gains the number of Knowledge Points printed on the card.
* __Combination__ (Comb): these cards are placed in the Player's Research Area. They reports a list of other cards to be purchased in order to gain the Knowledge Points associated with it and make other cumulative Powers available. The cards purchased to complete the combination, called __Components__, are placed face-up below the main _Combination_ card and are not considered in play. When the combination is complete, the Power printed on the Combination is activated and follows the rules described. If it is Immediate, the Combination card will be discarded with all the associated Componenta. If it is an Activation card, it is normally turned on using Power. If it is a Continuous card, Power always has effect. In the last two cases, the Component cards continue to be unusable.
* __Dark Bond__: some cards have this caption and the seed of a Great Old One to whom they are associated. These symbols are in turn displayed on various game elements (Arcane Place tiles, Great Old Ones cards, Ritual Object cards, Entity cards). Each time the Power of one of these elements is used by the player, the cards in his possession with the Dark Bond with the same seed will make the owner getting the number of Knowledge Points indicated by the cards themselves. Cards with the Dark Bond can also bring a Power according to the aforementioned types already described.
* __Ritual Object__: some Knowledge Cards can act as _Ritual Object_ cards. These cards are fundamental for using the powers of Invocation of the Great Old Ones and for the summoning of them (see below). Ritual Objects are normal Knowledge Cards with one or more of the powers already described, with the only difference that, when they are purchased, they are always placed in the Player's Research Area. If it is a Continuous Card, Power always has effect and at the same time it counts as a Ritual Object. If it is a Immediate card, when you decide to use Power, it should be discarded as usual and so it cannot be used as Ritual Object anymore. If it is an Activation card it is turned on for using the Power and for the remainder of the turn it is no longer considered a Ritual Object. If it is a Combination card, after completing the combination, it should normally be treated as described. Each Ritual Object has a Dark Bond link associated with the Great Old One who the card is able to summon with the three requirements which are needed to fulfill in order to advance on the Ritual Dashboard (see below).

As said before, Knowledge cards can be of one of these three seeds:

* __Forbidden Wisdom__ (FW): these are the most common cards in the Learning Area and represent tomes, artifacts, and spells. Each card has its own seed for purchasing (spending a Research Card of the same seed), the number of Knowledge Points that gives to its owner, one or more Powers and any requirements it may have for acting as Ritual Object.
* __Alien Science__ (AS): these cards represent nonhuman technologies and notions. Each card has its own seed for purchasing (spending a Research Card of the same seed), the combination to complete, the number of Knowledge Points that gives to its owner,  one or more Powers and any requirements it may have for acting as Ritual Object.
* __Dark Master__ (DM): these cards represent scholars, magicians and scientists having a respectable knowledge of Cthulhu's myths. Each card has its own seed for purchasing (spending a Research Card of the same seed), a Dark Bond, the number of Knowledge Points that gives to its owner,  one or more Powers and any requirements it may have for acting as Ritual Object. Remember that the Dark Masters follow the rules of the Dark Bond as stated above: whenever a Power of an Element with the same Dark Bond of a Dark Master is used, the owner gets the Knowledge Points for the Dark Master card itself. 

For the Dark Masters, the following _Dark Bonds_ apply:

* Powers of Arcane Places, which can be activated using Obsession cards;
* Summoning Powers on Great Old Ones cards; 
* Powers on Entity cards;
* Fulfilling the requirements on Ritual cards (see above) which are not Dark Masters themselves.


### Entity Cards
Entities are not Knowledge Cards and therefore do not give Knowledge Points to their owners. These cards are purchased by spending Obsessions, rather than Paths, when your Seeker is on an Arcane Place of the same seed printed on the Entity you want to invoke. Entities have the same types of Powers described above. Each card has the seed for the purchase, a Dark Bond and one or more Powers.

### Arcane Places
Arcane Places are divided into three types:

* __City__
* __Ruins__
* __Elsewhere__

Each card contains the icon of the type it belongs to, the seeds of the Knowledge Cards and Entities that allows the player to get, one or more Powers as described above, and the Dark Bond with one of the Great Old Ones in game.

A _Research_ action allows you to explore an Arcane Place with different effects. In order to be able to explore a place, you have to move your Seeker on the Place you want to explore.

Bringing the Seeker on a site is free and that marker stays on the card until the player decides to move it elsewhere, or he or she explore the site or an external factor (some Powers on Knowledge Cards) forces it to move away from from the card. The marker is positioned during the Search phase and can be moved to place in place, compatible with the Search Actions available to the player. Once exploring the site, thus taking advantage of the benefits of the Place, the Finder marker returns to its owner. An Arcane Place can be occupied by only one marker at a time so, until it is released, no other marker can be placed on the card. Instead, placing an Elders Sign (see) on an occupied Place will force the owner of the Searcher marker to withdraw it.

A player can always place his marker on a place where his Elders Sign is present (see below).

An Arcane Place must be considered as "explored" when one of the following applies:

* __Purchase of Knowledge cards.__ The seeds on the Place cards indicate which Knowledge Cards they allow the players to acquire at cost of their Path cards. Once you move the Searcher marker to a place with a Search action, you can immediately spend a Search Card of the same seed to acquire a Knowledge Card of that seed. This mechanism also applies to the Entity cards acquired with the Obsession cards. After purchase, the Seeker marker returns to its owner.
* __Use the Arcane Power of the Place__, by spending the required Obsession. As above, the Seeker token returns to its owner. In this case, also, remember to take the amount of Knowledge Points indicated by the Dark Master cards in your possession with the Dark Bond symbol equal to the of the place itself.
